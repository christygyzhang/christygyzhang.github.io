          <h2 id="about-title">About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello! I’m Christy. I recently graduated from the Master of Engineering in Computer Engineering program at the University of British Columbia.</p>
          <p>My work centers on data analysis and applied machine learning, where I enjoy uncovering insights from data and developing models that solve practical problems. I also have strong experience in backend development, which allows me to build the data pipelines and deployment systems that support end-to-end machine learning workflows.</p>
          <p>During my time at UBC, I worked on projects involving resource-efficient fine-tuning and deployment of large language models (LLMs) using techniques like LoRA, QLoRA, and structured pruning to improve performance on edge devices. I also contributed as a Research Assistant, managing large-scale data collection and model evaluation, and served as a Teaching Assistant for a business analytics course, where I helped students strengthen their data visualization and coding skills.</p>
          <p>I’m passionate about developing data-driven systems that combine intelligent modeling with efficient deployment. I’m currently seeking opportunities in data analysis and applied machine learning, where I can apply my technical and analytical skills to build practical solutions.</p>
